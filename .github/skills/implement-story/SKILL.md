# Implement story (orchestrator)

You orchestrate the implementation of story **$1**. You do not write feature code yourself.

## Hard rules

1. **You delegate. You do not write feature code.** If a subagent fails, relaunch with a sharper prompt. Do not hand-patch.
2. **Contract first, alone.** If any slice has `layer: contract`, spawn `contract-dev` and wait for it to complete before spawning anything else.
3. **File boundaries are enforced by a hook.** A merge conflict at Phase 4 means a subagent violated its scope — that's a prompt bug, not a diff to paper over. Abort and flag.
4. **Aborts are loud.** On any aborted run, leave the story branch intact, comment on the parent work item with the exact failure, and return a non-zero exit.
5. **No merges to main.** Only the feature PR is opened; humans merge.

## Procedure

### Phase 1 — Load context

1. Read `.github/project/PROFILE.md`, `github.md`, `overrides/implement-slice.md` (applies to orchestrator too), `guidelines/*`, relevant `stacks/*`.
2. Read `docs/designs/WI-$1/slices.md`.
3. Validate the slice YAML parses cleanly. If not, abort: write the parse error to the parent work item.

### Phase 2 — Group slices

```
contract_slices  = slices where layer == "contract"
backend_slices   = slices where layer == "backend"
frontend_slices  = slices where layer == "frontend"
infra_slices     = slices where layer == "infra"    # refuse these — flag for human
```

If `infra_slices` is non-empty, **do not proceed**. Comment on the parent work item: "Infra slices present; human implementation required." Return.

### Phase 3 — Contract first (if applicable)

If `contract_slices` is non-empty:

1. Check out a branch: `git checkout -b story/WI-$1/contract`.
2. Spawn via Task tool:
   - Subagent: `contract-dev`
   - Prompt: "Implement contract slices for WI-$1. Slice IDs: <list>. Branch: story/WI-$1/contract. Return the standard JSON summary when done."
3. Wait for completion. Parse the subagent's return JSON.
4. If `questions` or `blockers` is non-empty:
   - Open a draft PR on that branch surfacing the questions.
   - Comment on parent work item.
   - Return. **Do not proceed to Phase 4.**
5. Otherwise, merge `story/WI-$1/contract` into a new base branch `story/WI-$1`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b story/WI-$1
   git merge --no-ff story/WI-$1/contract
   git push --set-upstream origin story/WI-$1
   ```

If `contract_slices` is empty, create `story/WI-$1` from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b story/WI-$1
git push --set-upstream origin story/WI-$1
```

### Phase 4 — Parallel backend + frontend

Spawn in parallel using the Task tool (one call per subagent, issued in the same response):

**Subagent 1:**
- Name: `backend-dev`
- Prompt: "Implement backend slices for WI-$1. Slice IDs: <list>. Base branch: story/WI-$1. Your sub-branch: story/WI-$1/backend. Return the standard JSON summary."

**Subagent 2:**
- Name: `frontend-dev`
- Prompt: "Implement frontend slices for WI-$1. Slice IDs: <list>. Base branch: story/WI-$1. Your sub-branch: story/WI-$1/frontend. Return the standard JSON summary."

Wait for both. Collect both JSON summaries.

If either returns `blockers` or `questions`, do not merge yet — see Phase 5b.

### Phase 5 — Merge sub-branches into story branch

```bash
git checkout story/WI-$1
git merge --no-ff story/WI-$1/backend
git merge --no-ff story/WI-$1/frontend
```

#### 5a. Success path

If both merges are clean, run gates in this order. Stop at first failure.

1. **Test suite:** `gates.pre_merge` from PROFILE.md
2. **Compile checks:** `.github/scripts/check-compile.sh both`
3. **Startup check:** `.github/scripts/check-startup.sh both`
4. **Browser verification (Phase 5c)** — chained call below

If all four pass → proceed to Phase 6 (open PR).

If any fail → Phase 5b (conflict path), with the failure type recorded in the PR description.

#### 5c. Browser verification

Only run if startup check passed (otherwise app isn't responsive
and verification can't work).

```bash
# Read base URL from PROFILE
BASE_URL=$(yq -r '.gates.healthcheck.frontend' .github/project/PROFILE.md \
  | grep -oE 'https?://[^ ]+' | head -1)

# Confirm Chrome MCP is available
if ! github mcp list 2>/dev/null | grep -q chrome; then
  echo "Chrome MCP not available — skipping verification"
  echo "verification: skipped" >> /tmp/wi-$1-summary.txt
  return 0
fi
```

Then invoke the verify-story skill via the Task tool:

- Spawn subagent with the `verify-story` skill on slice WI-$1
- Wait for completion
- Parse the verification.md it produced
- If verdict is FAIL → demote PR to draft, attach verification.md
- If verdict is PASS → continue to Phase 6 (PR opens normally)

After verification, the report is committed alongside the implementation:

```bash
git add docs/designs/WI-$1/verification.md docs/designs/WI-$1/screenshots/
git commit -m "WI-$1: browser verification report"
```

#### 5c-skip. When to skip browser verification

Skip if any of these:
- `gates.startup.frontend` is `n/a` (no UI to verify)
- Chrome MCP not connected
- Slices have `layer: backend` only with no user-facing change
- PROFILE.md sets `gates.skip_browser_verification: true`

Log the reason in the trace and continue.

#### 5b. Conflict path

If either merge produces conflicts, or a subagent returned blockers/questions:

- Do not auto-resolve conflicts.
- Push all sub-branches.
- Open a DRAFT PR from `story/WI-$1` to `main` with a description that:
  - Lists each subagent's JSON summary verbatim.
  - Lists each conflict with file paths.
  - Notes "Scope violation detected" if a conflict exists between `backend-dev` and `frontend-dev` sub-branches (they should have disjoint files).
- Comment on parent work item.
- Return. Do not proceed to Phase 6.

#### 5c. Browser verification

Only run if startup check (gate 3) passed.

Determine whether to run:

- Skip if `gates.startup.frontend == "n/a"` in PROFILE.md
- Skip if all slices have `layer: backend` only
- Skip if PROFILE.md sets `gates.skip_browser_verification: true`
- Skip if Chrome MCP unavailable (check via `github mcp list`)

If skipping, log the reason and continue to Phase 6.

If running, spawn via Task tool:

- Subagent: `verify-story`
- Prompt: `Verify ACs for WI-$1. App is running locally. Base URL from PROFILE.md. Return the standard JSON summary when done.`

Wait for completion. Parse the returned JSON.

Branching logic:

| Verdict | Action |
|---|---|
| `READY_FOR_REVIEW` | Continue to Phase 6 — open PR as normal |
| `ISSUES_FOUND` | Continue to Phase 6 — but open PR as **draft**, with verification.md attached |
| `BLOCKED` | Continue to Phase 6 — open PR as **draft**, attach verification.md, surface BLOCKED reasons |
| `SKIPPED` | Continue to Phase 6 — note the skip reason in PR description |

In all cases, commit the verification report:

```bash
git add docs/designs/WI-$1/verification.md docs/designs/WI-$1/screenshots/ 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "WI-$1: browser verification report" 2>/dev/null || true
```

The orchestrator never opens PRs based on issues found — that is the human's call. The verification report becomes part of the PR for the human to read.

### Phase 6 — Open feature PR

```bash
# Decide whether to open as draft based on verification verdict
DRAFT_FLAG=""
if [[ "$VERIFICATION_VERDICT" == "ISSUES_FOUND" || "$VERIFICATION_VERDICT" == "BLOCKED" ]]; then
  DRAFT_FLAG="--draft"
fi

### Phase 7 — Update ADO + Slack

```bash
.github/scripts/ado-wi-update.sh <slice-wi-id> --state "Resolved" \
  --discussion "Implemented in PR <feature-pr-url>"

```bash
.github/scripts/slack-notify.sh "Feature PR open for WI-$1 — <PR URL>"

### Phase 8 — Handoff

```
=== STORY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ===
Work item: WI-$1
Contract branch: <yes | no>
Parallel subagents: backend-dev, frontend-dev
Feature PR: <URL>
Tests: unit <status>, integration <status>
Blockers surfaced: <count>

Next step: pr-review pipeline runs on the feature PR. Humans approve and merge.
